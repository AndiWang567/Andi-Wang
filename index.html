<p>Name: Andi Wang </p>
<p>Student ID: S3893716</p>
<p>Student email address: s3893716@student.rmit.edu.au </p><img src="IMG_5458(20220327-122147).JPG" alt="My picture" width="200" height="240">
<p>I am the Chinese international student of RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) university, and my discipline on university is the Bachelor of Information technology. I come from the Fujian province of China, I have been to Australia for 4 years; I enjoy the soft education environment and delightful natural environment of Australia. My favorite habit is playing computer games because it provides me a way of pleasure. what video games I favor are first-person shooter game likes Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and Counter-Strike. On the other hand, I also interest at real-time strategy game, as an example, the iron of heart IV. The sport I often did, I would like to make long run by cost a minimum of one hour per day, the explanation is doing sport can improve my personal health quality. </p>

<h2 style="font-size:200%;">1.The interest in internet </h2>
<p>I am interest in internet about programming and software development. All we know is that the computer game is a part of the data technology, once I was a child at the age of 5 to 6, an old computer with the Window XP software system putted in my front room. My uncle sometimes plays video games like Red Alert 2 by this old computer after he finished his job, and I often sit near my uncle to observe how he play the video game。 At the same time, I focused on the information values of the attack damage and health of the various soldiers and tanks within the game, often comparing which unit is stronger. this is how I start focusing on Information technology. I select RMIT university because of three reasons, first, RMIT university has the high reputation, and be well-known all round the world. Second, according to what my relatives who lived in Australia said, RMIT university has better teacher resources and effective experience on Information Technology. third, the teaching building of RMIT university is in the center of the Melbourn city, this implies that it’s has good traffic condition, their students don’t must to frightened of spending plenty of your time on the way to school, irrespective of they live in suburb or not. Otherwise, about my motivation, I wish I’d obtain the experience of software development during my study. </p>

<h3 style="font-size:200%;">2.Idea job </h3>
<p>My idea job is to be a software engineer. In common sense, many entrepreneurs of web technology platform who’s always desires for professional software engineer with high relevant skills and experience, for students of University, these requirements hard to be satisfied. In keeping with the knowledge from some recruitment sites, their requirements will be summarized as 4 kinds, first, employee need master at least four different programming languages such as C++, JAVA and react, this suggests that IT university students must learning autonomously, not only specialize in the knowledge from university.  Second, programmer must hand on experience with similar software. Because many entrepreneurs wish their employee would cognize basic information about the project they are developing, rich knowledge is more possibly to assist new employee adapting to figure in company, this condition would make people more attractive in labor market. Third, competent with relational technology or enough working experience. It's no doubt that all of IT Company yearn for professional programmer, to compare with college undergraduates, business can train this sort of employee to adept their business by cost less time resource. Fourth, employee need holds the Bachelor of Information Technology degree. Due to public education development and the circumstance of working environment become increasingly strict, people had better to carry academic degree at least, to confirm personal job security. </p>

<p>Now, what the current condition do I have, as a university student, I only have introductory knowledge of two programming languages (python and C#), I need to expand the range of programming language studying before I graduate. Then, I don’t have experience to figure on relational job, so, I better utilize my holiday time to join some IT project that would make improvement of my personal working experience. Third requirement, this is often the foremost to achieved, I need to spend at least 3 years to get the degree of the Bachelor of Information technology. additionally, to those conditions, the corporate may produce other requirements that I’ve not yet met. All in all, there are still many obstacles to be faced with becoming a software engineer in the future. </p>

<h4 style="font-size:200%;">3.Personal profile</h4>
<p>I am a RMIT college student and  I am still learning 	information technology discipline. I have experience of 1 year to work for local market, and the other half year for warehouse. My personal advantage is hardworking and work independently, when I get new job, I will firstly investigate how to encourage myself to work fast and effective. On the other hand, I am a sensible and easy-going person, my activity cannot be easily controlled by my bad emotions, because I don’t want to make another mistake or make others uncomfortable and embarrassed. In the respect of communication, I have health friend ties though I am not active inside, because I have good communication skill that’s beneficial for me to manage relation with my friend, at the same time, I also make friendly expressions to colleagues when working. I love to stay in quite environment, because this strategy will relax my brain, I could pay more attention to do something I planned. </p>

<h5 style="font-size:250%;">Project idea</h5>
<h6 style="font-size:160%;">(1) Overview </h6>
<p>Due to the rapidly development of entertainment, video games are popular with teens as a form of entertainment. Platform games initially ushered in the era of computer gaming, giving a lot of good childhood memories to kids in the 1980s and 90s. My project is planning to develop a platform game, which’s powered by Unity engine. This product is a kind of classical role-playing game includes two elements likes Roguelike, active. Player can control a character to fight against different enemy by various weapon, until reach the end of the game level to reach the ending or get killed on the way. </p>

<h7 style="font-size:160%;">(2) Motivation </h7>
<p>I choose to develop Roguelike game due to two reasons. As for IT university student, a people recently started certification exposure to programming languages. Platform game is a good challenge for the programmer who lacks relative experience, because this kind of game do not require good computer components, complex programs, and excellent art skills to develop, these conditions lead to people can develop them cheaply and easily. Second, the original function of game is making people joyful, my target video game players are teenagers who aged 15 to 25, so as a programmer, I aim to develop a game that players can admit to being fun, and it would be a great honor if it succeeds. </p>

<h8 style="font-size:160%;">(3) Description </h8>
<p>The nature of Roguelike game is eliminating different enemies with different weapons to achieve the ultimate goal, and it’s also an role-playing game, a grateful Roguelike game must have its completely story line, the story background is an old-fashion western magic story, there are multiple characters player can select before they start the game, those characters have various nature and clothing style, many characters have different “skill”, different options of roles will keep players the sensation of fresh as they play the game.  on the opposite hand, the enemy within the game also different, I will be able to design them on data text, giving them different health value, attack value, damage range. In some level, some elite enemy will appear to against player, those especial enemy have extra combat stats and unique skills, giving players an even bigger setback within the game. Unskilled player is probable that repeatedly killed by these enemies, this phenomenon will stimulate the player's desire to explore and win, prompting the player to continue playing. </p>

<p>irrespective of character design, the foremost attraction of Roguelike game is randomness, players are unable to search out the principles of game level design, they don’t know what’s thing will in next room. adventure in unknown situations to make themselves happy. Rewarding system and punishment systems are both exist, rewarding system is especially include chest and shopping system, chest system can provide powerful weapon and new skill to update character's health and attack value, and this rewarding is free to get, but how effective of the rewarding for people continue to play, which rely upon how luck. In a word, treasure chest’s function is to produce player unknown rewarding without cost. Shopping system contains a bit difference, Shops appear somewhere on the map rather like the treasure chests; shopping get some useful items to trade with players. About punishment system, it is triggered after fighting an enemy, especially after taking damage. It will give negative influence on character for a short time. Some influence like bleeding, intoxication, blind and so on, it attempts to Increase the playability of the game. That is all the advantage the video game has. </p>

<p> Potential disadvantage is existed which will result in game development false. Game developer and computer game player both specialize in one point, the balance, in terms of game difficulty, simple adventure games do not seem to be attractive, too hard games will scare people away, in the matter of result, setting the correct difficulty is a key factor in the game's popularity. But Roguelike game deeply depends on luck, such games cannot always give players a good gaming experience. Due to responsibility of programmer, my duty to test the game again and again to find the problem, then, redesign data text until the game is balanced enough. In the end, the game will be more attractive than before. </p>

<h9 style="font-size:160%;">(4)Tools and technology </h9>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity</a>--- Unity provides game developer the flexibility to form games and experiences in platform game(2D), and the engine utilize Mono offers a primary scripting API in C# , for both the Unity editor within the style of plugins, and games themselves, moreover, as drag and drop functionality. And this engine supports C since 2017s. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code">Visual Studio Code Editor</a>---this editor has obviously advantage that There is a wide range of programming languages available with this editor, such as JavaScript, C# and Python. </p>

<h10 style="font-size:160%;">(5)Skills required </h10>
<p>Completely game development is consisting with three part which are planning, programming and art. First, in the respect of character design and map design, it requires basic knowledge about 2D art, which need solid art foundation and art knowledge. Secondly, I need to fully master two programming language C# and C++, this aim to deal with Engine programming, script programming. Three, this game requires the necessary ability of numerical planning, proper numerical planning makes games more playable and balanced. </p>

<h11 style="font-size:160%;">(6)Outcome </h11>
<p>After I finished the game development, my first product may face the same situation that the new game developer and company may have. First product always commercial value, because this product lacks design experience and not well-known, so customer won’t pay for it with high price. But that not necessarily to me. Access to the first game development experience, my relevant personal skills have been strengthened, and my weaknesses will be identified as early as possible. Overall, this project will make me recognize my real abilities and make me no longer confused about the future. </p>
